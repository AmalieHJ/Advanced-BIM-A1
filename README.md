**Chosen use case**

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is chosen as the project use case, as it is a highly prioritised field in the building industry with yet further development potential. 
Today, LCA is to be found in all aspects of the build environment. This is mainly due to the coming law regulation of CO2 emissions on buildings starting in 2023. 
It is currently time consuming to perform an LCA model as well as gathering the right LCI (Life Cycle Inventory) from the building model. 
In order to make sure that the law regulations are met when the building is complete, iterative and continuously CO2 check points are beneficial. But due to the time spent on making an LCA it is not realistic to make iterative LCA checks for the time being. 
With our chosen use case within LCA, the goal is to make a script that links CO2 emissions from building materials to elements within an IFC model, thus enabling quick comparison of LCA climate impact for different choice of material within the model.  

The use case only relate to choice of materials within the LCA. Thus it does not deal with the energy frame which is usually part of the LCA. 
The IFC model does not contain information on source of energy for the building. Additionally, it is assumed that the energy supply varies only little as a cause of using different building skin materials, why the change in contribution is insignificant for the overall LCA results. 

**Stakeholder of the use case**

The use case recipients are engineers. However, overlap exists to both architects and the contractor.
